• XTREMEMusic™ is a project started by us back in 2014 with the goal of giving android users the best audio quality possible form their devices. How? By mixing every Sound Engine ever made for android in one big project.



How does it’s possible?

• In android devices there are some libraries in the System wich controlls how your device plays audio. When a company (e.g. Beats with its own Beats Audio) wants to insert in a specific device its own audio enhancements or engines it ask the manufacturer to include in its device some specific sound libraries that modifies how android plays sound files by adding their own proprietary effects. Since android is open source and so all its system files are avilable to everyone, it is possible to port those sound effects files to every android device and so, getting the same audio engines on all devices.
